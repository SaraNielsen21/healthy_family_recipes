<h2>About Us</h2>

<p id="summary"> This website was created in order to give people a source for healthy recipes and general tips for eating better. Everyone here at Healthy Family Recipes attempt to realize the same goal. That goal is to reach as many people as possible with healthy alternatives for recipes in hopes that they will become more healthy and fit.</p> 


<p class="odd"> You can find the different recipes spread out amongst a few separate categories found in the directory at the top of this page. We know eating healthy can sometimes be hard, but that is why we have these separate categories. These include entrees, appetizers, and yes, even desserts!</p>

<p>Below is a table of the distribution of nutrients that a person should attempt to follow as a guideline.</p>
